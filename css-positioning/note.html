<!-- Static is the default position all html elements have -->

<!-- Relative works like static positioning without top/bottom/left/right attributes. These attributes moves them according to their origin position. Which is not preferable method to move any item. -->

<!-- Absolute allows to place any page element exactly where I want it. Just like relative. Difference is that, if there is no parent (with any position relative or absolute), it will move in according with the html document. It will be placed relative to the page content.
* Most most important thing to remember about absolute positioning is that these elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesnâ€™t affect other elements.  -->

<!-- Fixed position works same as the absolute but a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled. This might be used for something like a navigation bar that you want to remain visible at all times regardless of the pages scroll position. -->

<!-- Sticky = relative + fixed -->
