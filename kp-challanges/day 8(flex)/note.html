<!-- By default, flex items want to be as small as possible. So, we should give them width: 100%  to make sure they all are in same size. -->

<!-- gap: 100px - to get gap between column. Same goes for column-gap. But it only supoorts in firefox. 
For 3 columns, this can be solved by - 
.col + .col{
    margin-left: 20px;
}
-->
