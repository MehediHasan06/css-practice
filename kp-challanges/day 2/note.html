<!-- ! em is a relative unit. It is related to it's parent. By default, 1em = 16px -->

parent{
  font-size: 10px;
}
child1{
  font-size: 1em; <!-- 10px -->
}
child2{
  font-size: 2.5em; <!-- 10 * 2.5 px -->
}

<!-- * em behaves differently in case of margin and padding. The relation is then with the font-size of the element. Not it's parent, but it refers to it's own element. This is very handy in case of a button. Padding is adjusted with respect to the font-size. -->

btn--small{
  font-size: 0.6em;
  padding: 1em 3em; <!-- 16*0.6px 16*0.6*3 -->
}
btn--large{
  font-size: 1.6em;
  padding: 1em 3em; <!-- 16*1.6px 16*1.6*3 -->
}
<!-- * padding is similar in both cases but thier values are different because of different font-sizes -->

<!-- ! There arise a compound problem in the case when using "em". Thats why we can use rem = root em. Which can only be change in proportionate with root -->
  :root{
    font-size: 14px;
  } 
  or, 
  html{
    font-size: 14px;
  }

  parent{
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  child{
    font-size: 1rem; /* 1*14px => getting the reference from the root*/
  }
-->

<!-- * There are some problem can be arised when using em. Which is surely the compound problem. Specially with ul/li tags. So, we shouldn't use font-size with em but with rem. we'll use em to use margin and padding and button .-->
