<!-- Normally websites are responsive by default.It is us who ruin the responsiveness of a website. Generally, it is done by using fixed height and width. -->

<!--
  1. Block elements are by default responsive with width: 100%. If we have to use a width, we should do it with percentage(%) value. Ex: width: 80%
  2. child div width is always with respect to its parent div. If child width: 50%, then it means that it is 50% of its parent's width.
  3. We should never use height. Instead, we should use padding.
