<!-- ! vw = viewport width & vh = viewport height -->
<!-- The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. so 100vh means the whole visible area's height of my device. -->

<!-- ! height/width: 100vh/vw vs height/width: 100%  -->
<!-- * percentage is always in reference to it's parent but vh or vw all about the viewport.We can realize the difference when we use width:100% on a section(whose parent is body) and on a button (whose parent may be a div) -->

<!-- ! vmax -> taking the bigger value of the 2 units (height and width) when growing or shrinking the viewport -->
<!-- ! vmin -> taking the smaller value of the 2 units (height and width) when growing or shrinking the viewport -->
<!-- We need too much practice to realize those elements -->

<!-- ! usage: -->
<!-- * vh = height, padding -->
<!-- * vw = title but not very useful for paragraph -->
<!-- * For responsive paragraph we should use vmax and vmin but very very careful when using them. They can reduce a lot of media-query but they are tricky to understand and use. We should be very careful and test them using different size of device. -->
